<!-- Code created by https://linktr.ee/saran709 -->

## üó≥Ô∏è Complete Vote Flow Process

### **Step 1: Voter Casts Vote**
1. **Voter Login**: Voter enters credentials (voter ID + password)
2. **Candidate Selection**: Voter selects their preferred candidate from the list
3. **Vote Confirmation**: System shows detailed confirmation with candidate name and party
4. **Vote Submission**: Voter clicks "Cast Vote" button

### **Step 2: Backend Processing**
1. **Vote Storage**: Vote is stored in SQLite database with:
   - `candidate_id` (which candidate was voted for)
   - `vote_timestamp` (exact time of vote)
   - Anonymous storage (no link to voter identity)

2. **Voter Status Update**: Voter is marked as "has_voted = TRUE" to prevent duplicate voting

3. **Database Tables Updated**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO votes (candidate_id, vote_timestamp) VALUES (?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
   UPDATE voters SET has_voted = TRUE WHERE voter_id = ?;
   ```

### **Step 3: Admin Dashboard Updates**
1. **Real-time Results**: Admin can see updated vote counts immediately
2. **Recent Activity**: Shows latest votes with timestamps
3. **Statistics Update**: Total votes, turnout percentages automatically updated
4. **Auto-refresh**: Dashboard refreshes every 5 seconds (if enabled)
